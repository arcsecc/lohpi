Backlog:
- When creating dummy data, use 0666 permission instead of 0777 beacuse it's too permissive.
- Refine the storing procedures of the meta-data. Remember to check how the elements are stored instead
the in-memory structs. Maybe we can send the raw bytes from the client instead of marshalling the data into the structs
to maintain the default encoding.
- When loading a node or setting a policy, remove the unnecessary function call to update the mux's cache.
Instead, make it more seamless. 
- Detach policy store from system and create its own executable 
- Find a smoother way to bootstrap the policy store and the mux. They should be able to start independently of each other
- Remove port flags and put them into config file
- Use Ifrit signature instead of Lohpi-level keys
- Use proper configuration tools (configor?) when bootstrapping the entire ssystem.
- Disconnect the components into separate build targets?
- Use protobuf instead of struct when passing messages over the Ifrit network
- Client implementation needs to be at the requesting package and not at the host
- Add signatures from the REC and Policy Store in all messages to verify the messages' integrity
- Fix cache interface so that it doesn't send to dead members
- Overhaul policy and gossip manager interactions with each other
- Consider writing a library for each entity and use the library at a higher level
- Use git submodule for each study
- Sync the distributed entities with each other so that things behave correctly
- MASSIVE TODO: move exposed entity API to a public directory and import internal stuff from there
- Move message verification to message package
- Fix membership overview in cache. What happens when a member dies? Use locks as well
- Implement LRU in probing session
- Redo policy and probing files in policy package
- PS won't always verify the signatures in messages coming from nodes.
- Network probing doesn't quite work.
